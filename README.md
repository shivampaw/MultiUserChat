# Multi Client Server Chat
Built with JavaFX this application allows you to either start a chat server or connect to one if you know the host and port.

## Download & Install
To run this you need a computer with Java 8 installed. Then just download the latest jar version from the [releases](https://github.com/shivampaw/MultiUserChat/releases) page and run it!

If you want to run the chat server on a headless device such as a raspberry pi then just run the following command from the command line `java -jar MultiUserChat.jar` and the app will start a headless version.

## Troubleshooting
If you can't get yours working globally then you probably need to port forward. Googling for "[YOUR ROUTER] port forwarding" should help you achieve this.
