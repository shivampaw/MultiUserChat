# Multi Client Server Chat
Built with JavaFX this application allows you to either start a chat server or connect to one if you know the host and port.

## Download & Install
To run this you need a computer with Java 8 installed. Then just download the latest jar version from the [releases](https://github.com/shivampaw/MultiUserChat/releases) page and run it!


If you wish to run the server on a headless device you can run the jar from a console by executing `java -jar MultiUserChat.jar headless [DESIRED_PORT]` and that will run the Chat Server in the terminal instead of a JavaFX application.

The desired port is the port that should be attempted first. If the port you enter is unavailable then a random one is chosen. To go straight to a random port use `0` or leave it blank.
## Troubleshooting
If you can't get yours working globally then you probably need to port forward. Googling for "[YOUR ROUTER] port forwarding" should help you achieve this.
